# TicTacToe

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.5.

Simple game of tic-tac-toe heavily inspired by react.js tutorial (https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#completing-the-game) and fireship.io course (https://github.com/fireship-io/angular-tic-tac-toe). All credits for tic-tac-toe algorithm goes to react.js tutorial creators.
Added some functionalities and rebuilt some elements (also no Nebular - it works on pure Angular v. 14, so the SCSS is maybe simplistic, but it's up to change maybe).
